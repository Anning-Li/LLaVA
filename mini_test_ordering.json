Also, when picking - try to get firmest and greenest pods! It can be very hard to find them in good shape here in the US, so just try to pick through the bin and find the least bruised ones. You'll notice mine have lots of dark spots and that's okay. P.S. If you can't find fresh fava beans where you are, you can buy them canned and dried, too! I prefer dried version like this one.",

It should break off but remain attached to the pod with a fibrous cord. Pull the cord down along the length of the bean. It should open up nicely, but if it doesn't, use your thumb to open and separate the pod.Discard any beans with large brown or black spots - but a brown line at the end of the bean isn't a reason to chuck it! That's normal. :)(If you have a worm farm or a compost bin, throw the pods in there. Our worms love the pods! We grind the pods up in the food processor and then feed it to the worms.)",

Once the beans are cooked, the pale outer skin should be easy to remove. If not, make a small slit with a pairing knife and squeeze the beans out. :)Some of the beans may split in half but that's okay. Still delicious!",
